Hi there, I'm Sayoneku 👋

I’m a builder who loves turning ideas into working tools. My projects centre around privacy‑first automation, self‑hosted systems, and clean user experiences. I care more about understanding why something works than memorising a specific programming language, and I’m happiest when a sketchy prototype becomes a polished solution.

What I do

🖥️ Linux / homelab / self‑hosting – running my own services, managing networks, and learning through tinkering

🔁 Automation – connecting tools like Notion and calendars with scripts or flows (n8n, bash, Python) to remove friction

📊 Data + visual interfaces – building dashboards and visualisers that make complex information easy to explore

🔐 Privacy‑focused setups – keeping control of my data with open‑source alternatives to cloud services

🛰 Space & tracking projects – real‑time ISS tracking and other space‑data experiments

Philosophy

I prototype fast, get the feel right, and then solidify. That means I’m comfortable “vibe coding” at first, as long as I can explain how it works later. Once the idea proves itself, I refactor, document and scale it.
Good systems last longer than frameworks, so I invest in understanding mental models: data flow, state, events, and dependencies. Languages are just different keyboards.

Featured projects

ISS Live Tracker – a real‑time tracker for the International Space Station with orbital predictions and a clean, zoomable map interface.

Homelab Monitor – a self‑hosted monitor that pings my services, detects outages and notifies me through multiple channels.

Automation Stack – a collection of scripts and n8n flows that connect Notion, calendar events, and system actions for seamless task management.

UI Playground – experiments in data visualisation focusing on simplicity, clarity and interactive design.

Feel free to fork any of these projects or open an issue if you have questions. I’m always open to feedback and collaboration.
